## EspHome Component to control and read values from a huawei r4850 power supply via CAN bus.

### Requirements
This component is currently tested and verified to work on a ESP32 using the Esphome **esp32_can** platform. So in addition to any **ESP32 board** of your choice you need a CAN tranceiver like the **sn65hvd230**. These are cheap and available from many sources and can be wired directly to the 3.3v GPIO and supply pins of the ESP32 board.
In theory it should work also with the mcp2515 platform, but this is currently not tested and verified.

### How to use

## Basic usage
Please check the provided example esphome configuration:
[huawei_r4850.yaml](huawei_r4850.yaml)

## Automatic excess charging

For automatic excess charging based on a home assistant sensor ("total system power") please check out the following example:
[huawei_r4850_excess_charging](huawei_r4850_excess_charging.yaml)

An additional 5V relay and a level shifter connected to a GPIO is required for this to work properly. The slot detection is being switched automatically depending on excess power and SOC. The charging current is being set depending on excess power and maximum allowed current (in this case 40 A).
